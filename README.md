# Plainloop

An interactive field guide for learning modern AI in plain language. Large type, short lessons, and hands-on demos.

Suggested Vercel project name: `plainloop` → [plainloop.vercel.app](https://plainloop.vercel.app). Checked on 13 Nov 2026: that subdomain returned `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND`, so no live project is using it. If Vercel says the name is reserved, `lucidatlas`, `primerlane`, and `lumenprimer` had the same open signal.

The interactive, visual AI playground for normal users and builders—not another wall-of-text documentation website. 

Explore **harnesses, MCP, context engineering, swarms, RAG 2.0, memory layers, guardrails, and loop engineering** through floating organic bubbles, 5-part lesson cards, animated interactive mini-simulations, relatable analogies, and tool-by-tool comparisons.

## 🌟 What This Feels Like

- **Floating Bubble Universe**: Gently drifting connected bubbles arranged into thematic learning islands. Drag them around, hover to see architecture links, or toggle reduced motion.
- **The 5-Part Lesson Format** (teach what a concept *helps you do* before its architecture):
  1. **Plain-Language Explanation**: 2–3 sentences with zero unexplained jargon.
  2. **Relatable Analogy**: Everyday metaphors (e.g. "A chef's specialty recipe card", "A universal USB-C cable for AI", "The airplane flight data recorder").
  3. **Interactive Mini-Demonstration**: Animated, step-by-step interactive visuals right inside the card (e.g., skill pack execution, MCP universal socket, ReAct loop stepper, swarm handoffs, guardrail scanner, AI gateway router).
  4. **Practical Relevance**: "Where would I encounter this in my AI tool?" with real-world touchpoints.
  5. **Quick Challenge**: Scenario-based question with instant explanations and celebratory confetti!
- **"Go Deeper" Collapsible Drawer**: Technical architecture summary, source papers, implementation notes, and nuance notes.
- **"Find It in My Tool" Product Picker**: Switch between Claude, Cursor / Codex, ChatGPT, Grok, and Open Source to see how each tool names, exposes, or configures the concept.
- **Guided Learning Paths**:
  - 💬 **I Use Chatbots** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini casual users)
  - 💻 **I Use Coding Assistants** (Cursor, Copilot, Codex, Claude Code)
  - 🤖 **I Want to Understand Agents** (Autonomous loops, graphs, harnesses, swarms, stateless MCP)
  - 🧭 **Explore Everything** (Every concept in the guide)
- **Searchable Island Directory**: Full list view grouped by island for quick reference, mobile accessibility, and keyword search.
- **Local Progress Tracking**: Tracks mastered concepts and solved challenges in your browser's local storage.
